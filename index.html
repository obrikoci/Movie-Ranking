<h1>The Best Movies I Have Watched</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies so far.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>
I really like this movie because it gets into detail about our minds reaching maximum capacity.<br />
For me it was like watching a documentary with a little bit of science-fiction in it.
</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>
It's a romantic movie, but it was one of the best that I have seen, beacuse it wasn't super cheesy in my opinion.
</p>

<h3>Uncharted</h3>
<p>
It was adventure and an interesring plot, with some unexpecting twists as well.
